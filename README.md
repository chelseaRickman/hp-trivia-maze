# Harry Potter Trivia Maze

## Summary

This was a school project I created for a .NET/C# course. It is a Harry Potter-themed trivia maze. The user starts at the entrance of the maze and must make their way to the exit. The maze is a 4x4 grid of rooms. To move to a room, the user must unlock the door by answering trivia questions correctly. If the user answers incorrectly, that door becomes permanently locked. If at any point the user permanently locks all of the doors leading out of the current room or locks the two doors that lead to the exit, the game is over.

This application was created using the Microsoft Windows Presentation Foundation framework.

## What I Learned

This is easily one of my favorite computer science projects I have worked on so far. .NET/C# was completely new to me, so learning the different nuances and syntax of C# was interesting in itself. The GUI aspect was fun to work with, I had very little experience with that before this project. Used a little bit of animation with the Harry Potter character in the maze. Became more comfortable with event handling. Utilized saving/loading of state which I had not done before. A lot of new things I discovered through this project, and I got to make something Harry Potter-related which was very enjoyable for my nerdy self.
